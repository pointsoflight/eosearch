# Points of Light EO Search

Points of Light EO Search uses the [IRS' Master EO File](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf) to convert a set of CSV files into a searchable API of Tax Exempt Organizations in the United States. Points of Light needs this to support other charitable organizations in our mission. 

This project stated as a National Day of Civic Hacking project by [Code for Atlanta](http://codeforatlanta.org)
